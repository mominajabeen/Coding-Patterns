The Tree Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal is a key technique in binary tree operations. It focuses on exploring one branch of the tree as far as possible before backtracking. This approach is useful for problems requiring tree traversal or handling hierarchical data.

The main types of DFS traversals include:

Pre-order Traversal: Visit the root node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
In-order Traversal: Visit the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
Post-order Traversal: Visit the left and right subtrees first, and then the root node.
